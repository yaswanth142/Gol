          <h3 class="indfnt">13.0 Prohibited & Restricted Items</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Both Prohibited and Restricted items could be subject to non collection, delay, return or confiscation by Customs. No refund of postage will be made and compensation claims will be void.<br><br>
            Please note GOL Couriers's booking systems are automated by computer software, therefore our staff are unable to monitor what is being shipped, so it is the customers responsibility to read the terms and conditions; to check their item is not listed on the prohibited and restricted items list or enquire directly via email to see if your parcel is acceptable.
            Prohibited items CANNOT be sent through our services. If any one of the items in the Prohibited Items list is collected by a driver you are then liable to be surcharged and your parcel returned.<br><br>
            Restricted Items can be sent but will travel without any inclusive or additional damage / loss cover and are therefore sent at the owners risk, no claim can be made under any circumstances for items in this list.<br><br>
            The Customer undertakes that GOL Couriers shall not be required or caused to carry or convey anything if such carriage or conveyance would be unlawful. The Company reserves the right to refuse any parcels which are neither the property of, nor sent on behalf of, the Customer.
            </p>


          <h3 class="indfnt">14.0 Surcharges</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Below are the circumstances in which the surcharges and additional charges become payable. The value payable will depend on the carrier used.<br><br>
            If the goods are not ready for collection by the Carrier at the place and time agreed, a charge for 'Nothing to Collect' will be made. A surcharge of Rs. 50.00 will be applied if there is 'Nothing to Collect'.<br><br>
            Additional charges may also be incurred where the Sender or the Recipient may have, by their actions, caused a failed or delayed collection or required additional packaging to secure a parcel or a failed delivery and the selected carrier service does not allow for such an event.<br><br>
            Transit times must be checked for the service ordered. On some services there will be a surcharge if a redelivery is necessary.<br><br>
            Some areas will be subject to a remote area surcharge. This will be calculated in the quoting system at the time of booking.<br><br>
            The Customer will be required under this Agreement to pay the full cost of the original fee calculated at the checkout should they cancel an order after it has been processed. Users are also liable for any additional surcharges that are levied by the carriers as a result of their cancellation.<br><br>
            Where the Customer chooses a carrier service that is not available to carry the physical parcel handed to the carrier or delivery service a surcharge for that delivery will be automatically applied.
            </p>

          <h3 class="indfnt">16.0 Damaged / Lost Claims</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The customer remains responsible for ensuring packaging is adequate for transportation. All items must be packed in a double walled box which is securely fastened with further padding surrounding the item making the item unable to touch the sides of the cardboard box or move whilst in transit. Inaddition the sender will be liable for any damages caused in transit to other shipments or property resulting from sending a consignment that is inadequately packaged.<br><br>
            Items not boxed or sufficiently packed are excluded from our services and could be subject to delay / return / held for collection by the customer. Such goods could also be discarded if:

             <li class="pad">they are damaged to such an extent such as smashed glass , or cause a concern in regards to health and safety regulations .</li>
             <li class="pad">If goods have been held for collection by customer and the time limit advised has been exceeded. Please be aware in such a circumstance, the customer will be aware that collection of said goods must be arranged by a certain date or the goods may incur storage charges, and finally discarded at a cost payable by the sender.</li>

            If the Sender combines packages without putting them in an outer box and the parcels come apart in transit, then no claim can be made against the consignment and the customer will be liable for any surcharges applied to the order.<br><br>
            No claim for loss or damage can be made on any Prohibited / Restricted items. Any additional compensation cover purchased on any Prohibited / Restricted items will be void and non-refundable. It is the responsibility of the customer to check that the item they are sending is not included in the Prohibited / Restricted items list prior to booking and sending the parcel.<br><br>

            In order for a customer to make a claim for a damaged parcel and/or contents - it is of paramount importance that the parcel is signed for as 'DAMAGED' otherwise any claim for damage will be refused. It is therefore the customers / recipients responsibility to check the contents of the parcel upon delivery to ensure there is no damage. If the recipient signs for a parcel in 'GOOD CONDITION' or 'UNCHECKED' then no claim for damage will be accepted under any circumstances, regardless of any tracking information entered or advise directly from the courier. It is the customer's responsibility to inform the recipient of these terms and conditions also.<br><br>
            In the event of damage, a Prohibited/Restricted item may be held for collection by the Carrier. This may be the case if the goods are Prohibited and cannot be sent or damaged to such an extent that onward forwarding is not possible. If this is the case you will be notified in writing that goods must be collected within 7 days following this point they will be discarded. If the goods are so badly damaged that the contents are destroyed or that the goods pose a Health & Safety risk then they may be immediately discarded, again you will be notified in writing. No claim can be made on a Prohibited / Restricted item.<br><br>

            In the unlikely event of a claim needing to be made please complete the online claims form and we will assist in the claim process. In the event of a claim - a copy invoice will need to be provided to prove the value of the consignment(s).
